         <p id="header">Scallions</p>
            
      <p>
        Scallions are super easy to grow! You can leave them growing in the garden for years at a time even they just get long! You'll want to loosen up the soil a using a gardening tool.
        It's best to grow the scallions in the spring for a summer harvest. You'd want to choose a sunny spot as these suckers like to soak up the sun! There should be some sort of drainage
        system to keep the soil well drained. These sorts of herbs grow best in pots containers like a garden bed where you can have layers in the box, such as a draining layer, a soil layer,
        a mulch layer, etc. You'd want to plant the seeds about 1/4th inch deep and space them about two to three inches apart from each cluster. Scallions have a shallow root system so
        conistently wet soil is key. A drip irrigation system would help with preventing overwating. The typical harvest time for scallions is around 60 days, but you can let them grow as long
        as your heart desires or just harvest as needed.

        <p id="header">Basil</p>
        <p>
         Basil is another fickle plant that needs conistent  drainage. Basil, just like the scallion, also enjoys direct sunlight. If you want to grow basil from the seeds then you'll want to scatter
         the seeds over the area you want to grow them and slightly cover with soil and water often. If you want to grow basil plants then you'll want to dig a little hole in the ground and water often.
         When it comes to the right season to plant basil, you'll want to pay attention to the tempterature. Basil could not survive any cold, frost would kill the plant so you'll want to wait until all 
         chance of frost is gone. Now, the time everyone is waiting for.... harvesting! Harvesting basil often is key to an abunadance of basil. You'll want to pinch towards the stem portion of the leaf
         and pull away from the plant. The reason harvesting basil often is key is due to the fact that you double each leaf every time you harvest one! That is right! When you harvest one leaf of basil 
         then two leaves will grow in its place! It's like a little natural plant hydra! Now the great basil flavor that we all know and love starts to disappear when flowers start to show. When you start
         to see flowers you'll want to trim them off. This will allow the plant to keep it's flavor without it being altered.

         <p id="header">Lettuce</p>
         <p>
             Lettuce is great isn't it? In order to grow lettuce you'll want to grow it in mild weather such as spring or fall. The great thing about lettuce is that it's not a picky plant in terms of growing
             area. You can grow them directly in the ground, in a garden bed, or in a container. You'll want to make sure this plant gets lots of sun! When planting you'll want to space them about six inches
             to 18 inches apart. Well watered soil is important so make sure to water any time the top of the soil is dry. The very top and a little below about an inch or so should be dry when you water. The 
             best time to plant lettuce is about a month before the last frost in your area. Some gardeners like to add mulch in the are they plant lettuce so that the soil will keep moist. The great thing about 
             lettuce is that you can harvest it virutally at any time once the leaves have grown to your liking. There are multiple methods you can utilize to harves them. Some gardeners like to harvest 
             starting with the outer leaves going towards the center bulb to allow the bulb to grow more leaves. Other gardeners like to cut the lettuce directly at the base when they believe the plant has grown 
             to thier liking. As well all know lettuce can taste all sorts of ways. Lettuce will taste batter if you grow it in cold climates, that is if you like a sweeter lettuce. Once the lettuce starts to expand
             it's leaves out you'll want to harvest immidietly or the leaves will taste bitter.

         <p  id="header">Cucumbers</p>
         <p>
            Cucumbers are delicious! You can eat them raw as a snack, make them into cucumbers, put them in a salad and many other things. There are two different types of cucumbers. There is the bush cucumber and the 
            vine cucumbers. The bush kind grow best in some sort of contianer since they are so compact. Vine cumcumbers can be utter chaos while they grow, they're vines without control they will grow out of control. 
            You can use a supporting tool like a cane or stick by tying the vines as they grow. When it comes to planting cucumbers you'll want to make sure the temperature is above 56 degrees consistently at night but 
            above 70 degrees during the day. You should plant the seeds about half an inch deep. For bush plants you'll want to space each plant about 36 inches to 60 inches apart. However for vine cucumbers
            you'll want to space those about a foot apart. Once the cucumber plants have grown around 10 inches tall then you'll want to position them in their final position. When it comes to watering then you'll want
            to water them every day. Did you read that correctly? Yes, yes you did. You will want to water cucumber plants every single day after all cucumbers are made up mostly of water. When it comes to harvesting these 
            bad boys and girls they'll become ready at about four inches to eight inches of height. You'll want to make sure they are nice and green, if they are yellow or orange that will usually shwo they are too riep. 
            This of course would vary on the type of cucumber you are growing so make sure to read the packaging. Cucumbers do have some
            pests, most commonly slugs. That's right slimy slugs. When you plant your seeds you might want to add a layer of straw mulch. It's believe that the mulch is hard for the slugs to move on which means that your 
            cucumbers can grow in peace.
